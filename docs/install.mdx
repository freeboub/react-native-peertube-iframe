:::

1. First install `react-native-webview`.

- React Native CLI app - [Instructions](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview/blob/master/docs/Getting-Started.md)

  - React Native **`0.60` and above**, install the latest version of react-native-webview.
  - React Native **below `0.60`**, react-native-webview version `6.11.1` is the last version that supports it.

2. Install

:::info yarn - recommended

`yarn add react-native-peertube-iframe`
:::

:::danger npm

`npm install react-native-peertube-iframe`

npm has some issues with peer dependencies where it tries to install all peer dependencies by default. If your project does not use react 17, it might case install failures. To get around this, use

`npm install react-native-peertube-iframe --legacy-peer-deps`
