### Removing context menu on long-press:

Wrap the `<PeertubePlayer />` in a View that has `pointerEvents="none"` to disable app touch-events to the player.

Then react-native's [Pressable API](https://reactnative.dev/docs/pressable) or any of the touchables to intercept presses.

example:

```jsx
<Pressable
  onPress={() => {
    // handle or ignore
  }}
  onLongPress={() => {
    // handle or ignore
  }}>

  <View pointerEvents="none">
    <PeertubePlayer (...) />
  </View>

</Pressable>
```

### Removing context menu on kebab menu (prevent share):

It is not possible to change to UI of the player. You can however achieve this by placing an absolutely positioned view on the player (either fully covering the player or just tall enough to cover the title) to prevent the webview from receiving user touches. This will not remove the logo or three dots, but will make it un-interactable.

example:

```jsx
<View>
  <PeertubePlayer height={300} videoUrl={'https://vidz.julien.ovh/videos/embed/105fd6ef-3048-43c3-b877-fdb8aaab11d5'} />
  <TouchableOpacity
    // TouchableOpacity to "steal" taps
    // absolutely positioned to the top
    // height must be adjusted to
    // just cover the top 3 dots
    style={{
      top: 0,
      height: 50,
      width: '100%',
      position: 'absolute',
    }}
  />
</View>
```
